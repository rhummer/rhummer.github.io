I've been using the amazing [Teslamate](https://github.com/adriankumpf/teslamate) software to keep track of charing/drives and other interesting data on my Tesla for a few years now. Hosted first on a RaspberryPi, then moved to my Synology server for something with a bit more horse power. Finally I wanted to move it to the Cloud for 100% uptime, and remote access. With out messing around with home network shenanigas.

I found the awesome setup article(s) here:

The guides worked, but they needed a bit more fenessing, so figured I'd make my own version to help out others..
